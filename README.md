# Rae Burket Shoes | 67250 Final Project

Developed as a frontend only project, our group built a website for a nonexisting shoe company, Rae Burket. Our purpose was to create a web site that could be used for customers to shop and connect with the company's philanthropy. Due to the nature of the project, most of the product content was hard coded since there is no backend support. The entire project was built using bootstrap and a web template.

The website is hosted using Now Server. For a live demo click here: https://ns-utapzcsnhz.now.sh
